# ShareHome 🏠

ShareHome is an AI-powered housing platform designed to help students and
low-income individuals find affordable shared rooms or private apartments
using map-based search and intelligent recommendations.

## 🚀 Features (MVP)
- User authentication (login/signup)

- Filters by city, area, price, and room type
- AI chat assistant for housing recommendations

and the AI agent converts this into structured search filters.
